      <p> 
        I am a Glasgow based web developer from the Isle of Lewis. Coding websites and mobile apps is what I'm best at, but I also have a strong interest in design and business. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you know what you want, or are just beginning to explore how an app or website could improve the way you do business, I can help.

    <h1> About me </h1>
    <p>
      I have worked as a salaried web developer for the last two and a half years. My off-hours are often spent working on my own projects, through which I have learned about mobile development, product development and design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am interested in the entire process of creating an app or website, and am always trying to broaden my skills. You can find out a bit more about me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-wood-922a8912a/"> Linkedin page</a>.
