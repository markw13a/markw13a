    <h1> Web developer </h1>
    <p> 
      I am a Glasgow based web developer from the Isle of Lewis. Technology &mdash; mainly creating websites and mobile apps &mdash; is what I'm best at, but I also have a strong interest in design and business. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy figuring out how to make life easier for businesses and their customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you know what you want, or are just beginning to explore how technology could improve the way you do business, I can help.
