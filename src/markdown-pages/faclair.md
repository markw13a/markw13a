Faclair na Gaidhlig is the most complete Gaelic dictionary available for Android. 

When I started to learn Gaelic in 2019, I found that there wasn't a dictionary available which was fast, simple to use and able to work offline. 

It seemed to me that creating the dictionary as a mobile app instead of a website would achieve all of these aims: it would be faster as there is no need to fetch data from a server, easier to use as it serves only one purpose and able to work offline as the data is all kept on the user's phone.

The project was a solo effort -- I managed all aspects of designing, developing and marketing the app -- and I had a first version ready within a fortnight.

Faclair na Gaidhlig is available on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faclairNaGaidhlig). At the time of writing, it has a over 100 regular users (including me).
